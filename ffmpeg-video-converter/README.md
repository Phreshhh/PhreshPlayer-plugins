# Video file conversion

Still I see today '.avi' and '.wmv' files, so..

.. if you drop an (or more) '.avi' or '.wmv' file into the player or playlist (works same as default file drop handling), then convert files to '.mp4' automatically (and change/add it to playlist also automatically after conversion).

**WARNING! High CPU usage while converting.**

The conversion unfortunately work only Linux and Windows. As far as I know, not works on MacOS and the CPU limit works on Linux only.
